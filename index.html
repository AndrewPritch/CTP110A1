<h1>Personal Information</h1> 
<p>Name: Andrew Pritchard</p>
<p>Student ID: s3792972</p>
<p>Email: pritchardandrew@hotmail.com</p>
	
<p>I am 33 years old and live on the Gold Coast. I was born in the small country town of Hay in NSW, where I lived until I was 19. I decided there just wasn’t much there for me, so I decided to make a major change and move to somewhere where there would be lifestyle, career and personal growth opportunity. For the past 12 years, I have worked for Toll Priority, in which over my time, I have progressed up through the roles of driver to supervisor, and I am now looking at a promotion of operations manager. My favourite past time is using killing time (when I finally get some) playing some retro Nintendo or my PlayStation 4. Favourite console of all time is my Super Nintendo, however can’t go too long without a good Nintendo 64 session. </p> 
<h2>Interest in IT</h2> 
<p>My interest in IT has always been there, however I guess when I was in my 20’s it took the back seat. I had a great circle of friends and worked a lot, but really enjoyed socialising on weekends and in my spare time would go to the gym. Now I’m a little older, I thought about getting back to something I always enjoyed. With my interest in retro gaming peaking in the last year, I started to wonder where I could go in this particular industry. Finding my current job less rewarding of late I began to consider what would be something I could do to get me excited about work again. Study was the obvious choice, and I could finally do something I was interest in. Having left school after completing year 10, and having no idea what to do for a career in my life, it was a very satisfying and exciting idea to look into IT and where it could take me.
</p> 
	
<h2>Ideal Job</h2> 
<p>Until recently I had no idea what aspect of IT I would be interested in working in. As a game enthusiast, I began looking on seek for jobs, then looking more towards specific websites. It wasn’t until one day I found myself on the Nintendo website, and discovered they were recruiting, and the key qualification required was an IT degree. I looked into studying traditionally, at an on campus style education, however this simply would not suit my work routine. When I looked into OUA, it became apparent that I could complete the INTRO TO IT and INTRO TO PROGRAMMING and then possibly make up my mind, as to what could be more suitable, and also, if I would actually enjoy this. Completing my INTRO TO PROGRAMMING course and I was hooked. I found myself excited about finishing work to come home and work on my Java and write basic code and programs that reacted when I ran them. I feel a programming job would not only be interesting but also fulfilling. Learning the skills necessary to pitching, presentations and team leadership within the industry, and with current supervisor / management experience, I feel I would be suited working in charge of a design or programming team.</p>

<p> For my third test, I chose a typing test, as I have found it could use some improvement. The test proved this!! I found this test at </p>
<a href=“www.thetypingcat.com”>The Typing Cat</a>

  <h2> Personality Test: </h2> 

<p>	-	As far as Defender goes, I guess I really don’t know. I have integrity in what I do and I stand up for others, not sure if that is what the personality type means but I guess I was surprised to see that result.
	-	From my experience in my current job and from past experience, I have no problem working in a team, both working in a leadership role or taking direction. I feel that the results from the test indicate that I would be open and transparent and fair in all circumstances.
	-	When forming a team I think I would be looking for like minded hard working people. I am a great judge of character and tend to be good at reading people based on their behaviour and mannerisms. 
</p> 


  <h2> Learning Style Test: </h2> 

<p>	-	With the varied questions within the test, I honestly couldn’t have guessed what my result would be. After seeing the result I completely agree. My learning technique is certainly not remembering lectures or passages out of books, but by gathering information and actually hands on attempting. 
	-	As far as working in a team, I feel that i would have the more hands on approach. If I can have the tool sin my hand as something is being explained to me, I have far greater chance of success and retaining the information. 
	-	When forming a team, I think I would take into account that not everyone may learn the same way as me. I realise that I may need to use different approaches for different members and take that into account.
</p>   

  <h2> Typing Test: </h2> 

<p>	-	I was not expecting much more than what I got however I guess I was hopeful it would be a little higher. I feel I definitely need to practise and work on my typing speed, especially moving forward with this industry.
	-	With not up to standard typing speed I could possibly slow down progress, both personal and within my team, on any particular project. This sounds extreme however I am someone who takes pride in my work and does not want to let anyone down.
	-	I would find team members who had a higher skill or similar to mine, and work to our strengths and may even take a back seat and do more supervision and planning.

  <h2> Project Idea </h2>
 <h3> Overview: <h3>

<p> My project idea is a new software programs with two aspects. A central program run from a main computer, and an app style program that works remotely on a mobile data terminal or a mobile phone that communicates with the main computer. The program is designed for delivery drivers and companies that want to keep track of live movements of deliveries and pick ups. This will assist transport companies in providing the best customer service with accurate ETA’s and constant monitoring of products and drivers, using 4G network and GPS location services. </p> 

<h3> Motivation: </h3>
<p> As a supervisor in transport, one of the biggest issues our customers have is not knowing when their delivery will occur, and for the people at the depot, not knowing where our drivers are. This will solve both these problems by allowing companies to expand on the software, to prompt text or email notifications of ETA’s, and progress of delivery. Much time is often wasted by both customers and customer service staff in calling drivers and taking verbal approx. ETA’s, holding up the driver and wasting customer time and often causing customer frustration and anxiousness. </p> 

<h3> Description: </h3>
<p>Imagine an easy to use program that can be run from a centralised location, possibly a logistics depot, that ‘talks’ with the delivery drivers scanner or mobile phone. Constant updates, driver run changes, additional work allocated to the driver, all simultaneously communicating with the central program to ensure best route and customer satisfaction. Many programs already exist that are similar to this, however are no where near as effective or efficient. This program will revolutionise the delivery industry by focusing on cost effective, customer driven accurate delivery services.
Utilising both 4G networks and location services through GPS, the centralised computer can effectively pin point location of drivers, and project delivery times, based on where they have to go with further deliveries. Allowing the camera function in conjunction with performing a delivery, drivers can accurately capture exactly where the package was left, if no signature is required and driver leaves at front door. This can all be stored on a central server along with the signatures and all other package tracking information. 
The driver begins the day with all product being scanned into their device, which will auto populate all names and addresses of deliveries and pick ups for the day. This will create a ‘run sheet’. The program will auto populate the delivery order, based on maps stored within the device. Map updates can be done on a weekly basis, such as overnight or on weekends to avoid interruption to delivery requirements. At any time, the driver can over ride the auto organisation, to allow for human input in case an error or misplaced delivery structure. This will update on the centralised computer to inform supervisors etc of exact order of deliveries. This can also be a useful tool for depot staff to question drivers, on the particular order they have set up their day.
In an average company / depot, approx. 100 phone calls for enquiries are taken by staff daily, to check on the status of a delivery. If customers are unable to receive notifications, they can still call the depot and receive an accurate ETA or status of delivery. If a customer requires changes such as ‘please leave at front door’ or ‘do not deliver, customer will collect instead’ etc, these messages can be sent directly to drivers holding or updating the delivery. Communication with drivers is key, however phone calls to drivers is not only time consuming, but also could be dangerous if the driver is actually driving at the time.
A concern people may have is privacy and security. Is it ethical to be monitoring drivers movements like this? Put simply, yes. There is no video recording of drivers, there is no audio recording of drivers. The driver’s personal space is not being invaded in any way. The driver is completely safe, and the GPS tracking is simply for security of the vehicle and freight, but also for productivity and driver safety. 
</p> 

<h3> Tools and Technologies: </h3>
<p>Hardware required would be a stable server running one or multiple computers on the same network. Every delivery driver would require a mobile data terminal (scanner) or a mobile phone. Each terminal would require sim cards on a reliable network, and built in features such as GPS accessible hardware and location service hardware.
Software required would be a complex main program, that allowed centralised delivery of messages, data reading and storage software, location services software, simultaneous communication between mobile computers and the main central program. An adaptable app that can be used on a mobile phone in the event of not having a mobile terminal, with complete working features.
</p> 

<h3> Skills required: </h3>
<p> To make this program would require experienced software developers with experience in telecommunication or messaging program writing. Software professionals that have worked with GPS, application design and function, computer software programming, network experience including experience with servers. Hardware would be any required computers, server hardware with high storage capabilities, outgoing and incoming message and GPS reading hardware. For the driver application mobile phones with location settings, touch screen, network features (sim card) and camera. If mobile data terminal same as phone. All skills required are basic and should have no problem assembling a team with the required experience. </p> 

<h3> Outcome: </h3>
<p>If the program is successful, the benefits for the logistics company would be immeasurable. Constant tracking or monitoring of all stock / deliveries, vehicles and drivers. Better customer service and satisfaction, with updated ETA’s of deliveries or pick ups. Less time wasted on answering basic customer concerns or enquires and more motivated drivers as they would have a great software program that works well for them. Less driver frustration with forgetting deliveries or not being able to locate an address. Easier supervision of drivers by allowing management to locate staff at all times and audit particular runs easily and live.
